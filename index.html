                    <p class="lead mb-5">Chen Chen is a MS student pursuing a degree in Data Science at NYU CDS. She has over three years of professional experience in applying analytics in asset management as a senior investment analyst. Chen has demonstrated analytical skills through school and passion projects such as predicting kidney functions post-surgery, analyzing synthetic medical data with SQL, and creating music recommendation systems. Professionally, Chen’s most recent internship in quantitative trading at UBS allowed her to explore innovative techniques such as Twitter sentiment analysis, text-scraping Bloomberg broker conversations to synthesize pricing information, and backtesting customized indexes to optimize investment decisions. At Strategic Investment Group, Chen supervised quality-control for client reporting and helped select private equity managers through analysis such as cash flow modeling and Porter's Five Forces. Currently, Chen shares her knowledge as a Teaching Assistant for causal inference at NYU and serves as an admissions ambassador for CDS. With a proven record working in fast-paced environments, Chen is seeking roles in Data Science and analytics, with a particular interest in leveraging machine learning or causal inference to solve real-world problems. Outside of the world of data and algorithms, you can find Chen swaying to the rhythm of salsa on New York’s piers.</p>

                                    <p> In this study, we developed a predictive model that uses pre-operative patient characteristics and surgical intervention type to predict short-term postoperative renal function. Data were sourced from electronic health records at NYU Langone Health, involving mainly white males aged 50 to 70, many of whom were overweight with hypertension and diabetes. After data cleaning and preprocessing, we applied Multiple Linear Regression and XGBoost, with and without recursive feature elimination, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 18-23%. With further refinements, this model could help clinicians and patients choose the best treatment strategy by predicting postoperative renal function weeks after surgery.</p>

                                    <p>Leveraging natural language processing techniques such as text extraction, stop word removal, tokenization and word count, this project compares the sentiment of fiscal year 2022 10-k financial reports for five pharmaceutical companies: Pfizer Inc., Moderna, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Company and AbbVie Inc, based on text in items 1A. Risk Factors and 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The output includes a quantitative comparison of sentiment word frequency and lists of top ten sentiment words that most frequently appeared for each company. </p>
